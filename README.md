# File storage support for Lhotse
[![Build status](https://badge.buildkite.com/d5a0c236b0dd90d368dd448f4010eaee15d409f5c6c8a20b2a.svg?branch=main)](https://buildkite.com/everest-engineering/lhotse-storage) [![Quality Gate Status](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=everest-engineering_lhotse-storage&metric=alert_status)](https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=everest-engineering_lhotse-storage)

This is a supporting repository for [Lhotse](https://github.com/everest-engineering/lhotse), a starter kit for writing event sourced web applications following domain driven design principles.

# Purpose
This library implements two file stores: one is referred to as _permanent_, the other as the _ephemeral_ store. The permanent file store is for storing critical files that, such as user uploads, cannot be recovered. The ephemeral store is for non-critical files that can be regenerated by the system either dynamically or via an event replay.

Our file store implementation automatically deduplicates files. Storing a file whose contents matches a previous file will return a (new) file identifier mapping to the original. The most recently stored file will then be silently removed. 

File stores need backing service such as a blob store or filesystem. This starter kit supports 
[Mongo GridFS](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/gridfs/) and AWS S3 at time of writing.

#### Configuring Mongo GridFS
Set the application property:
```
application.filestore.backend=mongoGridFs
```

#### Configuring AWS S3
Set the following application properties:
```
application.filestore.backend=awsS3
application.filestore.awsS3.buckets.permanent=sample-bucket-permanent
application.filestore.awsS3.buckets.ephemeral=sample-bucket-ephemeral
```

We rely on [DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/auth/DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain.html) 
and [DefaultAwsRegionProviderChain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/regions/DefaultAwsRegionProviderChain.html) 
for fetching AWS credentials and the AWS region.
